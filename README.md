# IMV-Part-1

A seminar project at Faculty of Computer and Information Science at University of Ljuvljana.

To run open index.html, best with a local server (such as the one offered by python), or go to the [public version](https://vooku.github.io/IMV-Part-1/). 

You can either load MIDI file â€“ a sample is located in the _assets_ folder, play your computer keyboard as if it was a synth or connect your own MIDI device (sadly only Google Chrome supports that for now).
